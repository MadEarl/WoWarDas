Android App to qqquickly store a GPS location

I don't know where those three q's came from, but I'll leave them now. :)

This app aims to solve a particular problem that maybe only I have. I like to ride motorcycles, 
and sometimes I drive by a location that looks nice and that I want to check out in detail later.

This app is supposed to accomplish that while not interfering with riding or my navigation on the 
phone. Android 10 phones have a PTT button that, on my Ulefone Armor 9, can be configured to 
start any app. Like this one.

This app does one thing: It records the current location, and unless the user presses a button 
to list all the previous locations, writes the location down and quits. So, on one push of a button,
I have a record of where this button was pushed.
